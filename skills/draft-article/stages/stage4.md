## Stage 4 — owner verification pass

A bounded pass where the owner resolves the draft's `[VERIFY]` markers within a
**≤4 minute** owner-attention budget. Exit criterion: **zero `[VERIFY]` markers remain**.
Build the owner's worklist:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/draft-pipeline.py verify <draft>
```

This lists every well-formed marker with its **line and reason** (a malformed
marker blocks the pass — Stage 3 must have produced canonical `[VERIFY: <reason>]`
forms). Present each marker to the owner under the
[owner-facing proposal contract](../../owner-facing-proposal-contract.md): **where**
the claim sits in the article (its section, with the surrounding sentence as a
preview), **why** it is flagged (the marker's reason), and choices whose labels
state their **concrete effect on the article** — never a shorthand. A first-time
owner answers from **repository knowledge alone**. Resolve **each** marker to
exactly one of:

1. **replace the claim with its source** — the claim was verifiable after all;
   swap the marker for the source pointer (`path:line@sha` / sha / URL);
2. **keep the claim, marked as an unmeasured estimate** — the owner vouches for
   it; drop the marker;
3. **remove the claim from the article** — it cannot be supported; delete it.

The pass is done when the Stage-3 gate reports zero:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/draft-pipeline.py verify-markers --count <draft>   # -> 0
```

**More than one rewrite routes back to a question, never open-ended editing.**
A section gets **one** rewrite in this pass. If the owner asks for a further
change, do not keep editing — reroute it into a new, bounded interview question:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/draft-pipeline.py reroute --section <id> --rewrites <n>
```

With `n` = rewrites already applied to that section, this returns `decision:
edit` while a rewrite remains, or `decision: reroute` (with `next_stage:
interview` and a bounded question) once the budget is spent. Ask the rerouted
question, capture the bullet answer verbatim as in Stage 2, and apply it — the
draft never drifts into unbounded editing.

Stage 4 exit: zero unmarked invented claims, zero `[VERIFY]` markers — the draft
is ready for the article plan and the `complete` gate. Variant emission is
**not** part of this flow (see the pointer section below).

**Stage 4 exit → completion.** Read [`complete.md`](complete.md) and run:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/draft-pipeline.py complete --draft … --slug … --root … --ws …
```
